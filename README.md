# RCO IT Help Site

An internal IT portal for Rowe Casa Organics staff.

**View the live demo:** [hhowell116.github.io/Demo-RCO-Help-Site](https://hhowell116.github.io/Demo-RCO-Help-Site/)

> The demo site uses mock authentication and in-memory submissions. This repo contains the production source code with Firebase Auth and Firestore.

## Features

- **Google Auth** — Sign in with Google, restricted to `@rowecasaorganics.com` accounts only. Sessions persist across devices. Unauthenticated users are redirected to `login.html`.

- **Technology & Application Discovery Survey** — Collects a full inventory of tools and accounts per department. Includes conditional logic that shows only relevant tool categories based on the user's selected department.

- **Request Forms** — User Onboarding, Offboarding, and Equipment/Software Request forms *(in progress)*.

- **My Completed Tab** — Submissions are saved to Firestore and tied to the user's account, visible across any device.

- **Contact IT Support** — Opens Gmail with `itsupport@rowecasaorganics.com` and the user's message pre-filled.

- **Google Sheets Integration** — Survey responses are sent to a Google Sheet via Apps Script. One row per tool entry. Each submission is color-highlighted for easy reading.

- **Styling** — Sourced from RCO brand colors. Fully responsive with dark mode support.
